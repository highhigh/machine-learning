    "\n",
    "Grocery sales forecasting is critical to grocery detailers, as they may get stuck with perishable goods if overstocked, or lose custormers if understocked. Corporación Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer, owns 54 stores in different cities/regions in Ecuador. It has this challenge on Kaggle in order to have a better prediction of  product sales."

In this project, historical datasets are provided to tackle this problem: sale records from Jan.1 2013 to Aug.16 2017, along with some other historical data, such as oil price, transaction, etc.  \n",
    "Based on historical sales records and related factors, supervised machine learning method can be employed to predict product sales."
